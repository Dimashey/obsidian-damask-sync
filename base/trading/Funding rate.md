# Key Takeaways

- In [[Perpetual Futures|perpetual futures]] markets, funding rates define the periodic payments between long and shorts traders.
- Funding rates help maintain market stability by keeping futures contracts prices aligned with underlying assets' prices on the spot market.
- The amount paid is based on the difference between the perpetual futures mark price and the index price.
- When the funding rate is positive, long positions pay a funding fee to short positions. When funding rate is negative, short positions pay a funding fee to long positions.

## What Is the Funding rate?

Funding rates are periodic payments made between traders who are long and those who are short in a perpetual futures markets. The funding rate can be either positive or negative, depending on the relationship between the perpetual contract and the spot price. When the price of a perpetual futures contract moves away from the underlying spot price, the funding rate will encourage traders to open positions in the opposite direction to receive funding fees.

## How Funding Rates Work in Crypto Trading
The funding rate consists of two main components: the **interest rate** and the **premium index**

### 1. Interest Rate 
The interest rate component reflects the [[Cost of capital|cost of capital]]. In crypto trading, this usually represents the difference in borrowing costs between the base currency(USD) and the quote currency (BTC). This rate is typically small and relatively stable.

### 2. Premium index
The premium index measures the difference between perpetual contract price and the spot price of the underlying asset. When the perpetual contract price is higher than the sport price, the premium is positive, indicating a strong buying interest. Conversely, when the perpetual contract price is lower than sport price, the premium is negative, indicating strong selling interest.

## Funding Rate calculation
The funding rate is calculated based on the interest rate and premium index values. However, the exact formula may differ from one exchange to another. Make sure you understand how it works on the exchange you are using before taking risks.

## Why Funding Rates Matter

1. **Maintaining price parity:** It ensures that the price of the perpetual futures contract stays near the sport price of the underlying asset.
2. **Market participation**: If the contract price deviates from the sport price, the funding rate mechanism encourage traders to open positions that bring the prices back in line.
3. **Reflecting market sentiment**: The funding rate may also be used as an indicator of market sentiment.
