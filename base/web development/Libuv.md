**libuv** is a multi-platform, open-source library that provides asynchronous I/O capabilities and event-driven programming for Node.js.

## Key components

### Event loop

- The core component of libuv, responsible for **handling events, scheduling tasks, and managing asynchronous operations**.
- The event loop **monitors I/O operations** (like network requests, file I/O, timers) and **dispatches callbacks** when these operations are complete.
- It uses the **epoll** (Linux), **kqueue** (BSD, macOS), **IOCP** (Windows), or other system-specific mechanisms to efficiently handle I/O events.

### Thread pool

- libuv includes a **thread pool** for executing blocking operations (like DNS lookups, file I/O, and CPU-bound tasks) in a separate set of worker threads.

### Asynchronous I/O

- libuv **provides a consistent API for asynchronous I/O operations** across different platforms. This includes file system access (reading and writing files), network communication (sockets), and other I/O tasks.

### Cross-Platform Abstraction Layer

- libuv **abstracts platform-specific I/O features** (such as file systems, networking, and concurrency), making Node.js **run consistently across different operating systems**.

### Timers

- libuv provides support for **timers**, allowing delayed execution of functions with `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and similar functions in Node.js.

### File system operations

- The library abstracts file system operations, providing both asynchronous and synchronous interfaces to perform file reads, writes, and more complex tasks such as directory listing or file metadata retrieval.

### Networking

- libuv manages asynchronous **networking** operations, handling TCP, UDP, and other network protocols. It provides APIs for creating and managing network sockets, and for handling data transmission and reception.

### Child processes

- libuv supports the creation and management of **child processes**. This allows Node.js to spawn child processes, execute external commands, and manage inter-process communication (IPC).

### Signal Handling

- libuv includes support for handling **operating system signals** (e.g., `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`), which allows Node.js to gracefully handle system events such as process termination.

### Concurrency Control

- Through the use of the **thread pool**, libuv supports concurrent operations for CPU-bound tasks. This makes it possible to perform complex, long-running tasks outside of the main event loop, avoiding performance bottlenecks.
