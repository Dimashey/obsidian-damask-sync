In Node.js, the **event loop** plays a crucial role in managing asynchronous operations and enabling non-blocking I/O.

## Components

1. Call Stack. The call stack is where all the synchronous code execution happens. When functions are called, they are pushed onto the stack, and when they return, they are popped off.
2. Task Queues
	1. **Macrotask Queue**.This queue contains tasks scheduled by APIs like `setTimeout`, `setImmediate`, and I/O operations. Tasks from this queue are executed one at a time when the call stack is empty.
	2. **Microtask Queue**: This queue contains high-priority tasks such as resolved promises and `process.nextTick()`. Microtasks are executed immediately after the current operation completes and before the next macrotask.
3. Node.js APIs. Node.js provides various APIs to handle asynchronous tasks, such as file I/O, network requests, timers, etc. These APIs are not part of the JavaScript language itself but are implemented in the Node.js environment.
