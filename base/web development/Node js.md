## What is nodejs?

Node js is a **runtime environment build on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine** that allows that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. Unlike traditional JavaScript, which is typically confined to browsers. Node js extends JavaScript's capabilities to perform backend operations, such as handling http requests, interacting with databases, and performing file operations.

## Advantages

### 1. Asynchronous, Non-blocking Architecture

Nodejs operates on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, enabling it to handle many request concurrently without creating a new thread for each one.
### 2. Same language for Frontend and Backend:
### 3. High Performance

### 4. Large Ecosystem of Libraries
### 5. Scalability

## Disadvantages

### 1. [[Weak point of nodejs|Single-threaded]]

While efficient for I/O - heavy operations, Node js is a single threaded, which it makes less suitable for CPU-intensive task, such as image of video processing.
### 2. Lack of strong typing
